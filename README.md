# Water Potability Classification Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a neural network-based classification model to predict water potability using a dataset containing various water quality parameters. The model is designed to classify whether water is potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable based on given features.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple numerical features representing water quality indicators, with a target label Potability:
<li>0: Non-potable water</li>
<li>1: Potable water</li>
Missing values were handled using mean imputation, and the features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure uniform scaling.
